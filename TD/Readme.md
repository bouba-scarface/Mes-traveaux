## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

​
You are asked to write a function `insideOut` that returns a word turned "inside out". That means the internal letters will move out, while the external ones will move toward the centre.
​
If the word is even length, all letters will move, for example:
​

```
insideOut("taxi") // should return "atix"
```

​
If the length is odd, you are expected to leave the 'middle' letter of the word where it is, for example:
​

```
insideOut("taxis") // should return "atxsi"
```

​

## SPECS

​
Write your `insideOut` function in an `index.ts` file with the following specifications:
​

- it should take a `string` as a parameter
- it return a `string` which is the one given as a parameter with its letters `inside out`
  ​
  You are free to do it as you want, there no test for this exercise, the only one is to make the function work.
